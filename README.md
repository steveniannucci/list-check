# list-check
This app allows users to make a list of items that would be saved on their device. There is a separate feature where users can make an additional list of items that can be accessed globally in the application. If the user inputs an item that matches the input in that list, it will highlight the item and leave a warning with a link to the list so they can see it on there and the reason why. Mainly for making shopping lists but could also be used for any other type of list.

Features:
Allows user to create lists.
Allows user to create individual no lists (per list).
No list includes item name and reason for why it's on the no list.
When user attempts to save an item to a list, if said item is already on the corresponding no list, the user will be given a warning with the information about the item and a link to the no list.
Search feature for the user's convenience to filter items on both types of lists.
